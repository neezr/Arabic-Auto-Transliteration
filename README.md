[>>> Open Arabic Auto Transliteration](https://neezr.github.io/Arabic-Auto-Transliteration/)

[>>> Open Hebrew Auto Transliteration](https://neezr.github.io/Arabic-Auto-Transliteration/hebrew.html) (experimental)

## Currently supports:
- Arabic Script
- DMG-Transliteration (DIN 31635 standard)
- Encyclopedia of Islam-Transliteration (EI-Transliteration)
- Buckwalter Transliteration
<!-- -->
- _Hebrew Transliteration to ISO-259 (experimental)_

**Note:** The common transliteration standards (except Buckwalter) are lossy, so automatic transliteration will never be perfect.
Use this as a tool to speed up your workflow, not as a replacement for a language expert.
