# Arabic Auto Transliteration

An online tool for converting between different transliterations of Arabic.

[View as GitHub Page](https://neezr.github.io/Arabic-Auto-Transliteration/)

## Currently supports:
- Arabic Script
- DMG-Transliteration (DIN 31635 standard)
- Encyclopedia of Islam-Transliteration (EI-Transliteration)
- Buckwalter Transliteration

**Note:** The common transliteration standards (except Buckwalter) are lossy, so automatic transliteration will never be perfect.
Use this as a tool to speed up your workflow, not as a replacement for a language expert.
